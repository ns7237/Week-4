* Overview
This week introduced several core and modern Java features that help in writing generic, safe, reusable, and testable code. We explored data handling using collections and streams, improved our coding safety with exception handling, and learned about the functional programming support in Java 8.

* Topics Covered
* Day 1: Java Generics
What are generics and why use them?

Generic classes and methods

Type parameters (<T>, <K, V>)

Bounded type parameters

Benefits: Type safety, reusability, cleaner code

* Day 2: Collections
Overview of Java Collection Framework

List, Set, Queue, and Map interfaces

Implementations: ArrayList, HashSet, LinkedList, HashMap, TreeMap

Iterating through collections (Iterator, for-each, forEach)

Sorting and searching collections

* Day 3: Java IO Streams
Byte vs Character streams

FileInputStream, FileOutputStream

FileReader, FileWriter, BufferedReader, BufferedWriter

Using try-with-resources for safe file handling

Reading/writing text files

* Day 4: Exceptions
Types of exceptions: Checked vs Unchecked

try, catch, finally, and throw

Creating custom exceptions

Exception propagation and best practices

Debugging and error reporting

* Day 5: Regex & JUnit
Regular Expressions (Regex):

Pattern matching with Pattern and Matcher

Common expressions: email, phone, etc.

JUnit Testing:

Introduction to unit testing

Writing test cases using JUnit

Assertions and test annotations

Test-driven development basics

* Day 6: Java 8 Features
Lambda Expressions

Functional Interfaces (Predicate, Consumer, Function)

Stream API for processing collections

Optional class

Method and constructor references

* Prerequisites
Prior knowledge of Java syntax, classes, and methods

Basic understanding of OOP and exception handling

Java 8 or later installed
