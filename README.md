* Overview
This week covered working with structured data formats and introduced tools for metadata processing and dynamic behavior in Java. You also learned about important design principles that guide writing clean, maintainable, and scalable code.

* Topics Covered
* Day 1: CSV Data Handling
What is CSV (Comma-Separated Values)?

Reading CSV files in Java using:

BufferedReader

OpenCSV (if libraries were used)

Parsing and processing CSV data

Writing data back to CSV files

* Day 2: JSON Data
Introduction to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)

Parsing JSON in Java using:

org.json

GSON or Jackson libraries (if used)

Converting Java objects to JSON and vice versa

Real-world use cases for JSON (e.g., APIs)

* Day 3: Annotations, Reflection & Design Principles
Annotations in Java:

Built-in annotations: @Override, @Deprecated, @SuppressWarnings

Custom annotations (if covered)

Reflection API:

Accessing class metadata at runtime

Dynamic method invocation

Design Principles:

DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself)

KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

SOLID principles (overview)

Importance of clean code practices

* Prerequisites
Strong understanding of Java classes and file handling

Familiarity with object-oriented concepts

JDK and any relevant JSON libraries installed

* How to Use This Repository
Content is organized by day in folders. Each folder includes:

Java code examples

Sample CSV/JSON files (if any)

Notes and documentation

You can experiment with the data and modify the code for better understanding.

* Next Steps
In Week 5, you'll likely dive into Spring.
